# University Management
This is my final project for the Database Course from my faculty. It was made with Python :snake: and Tkinter. It is a desktop application, basically the front-end and back-end for my database. You can make basic CRUD operations and also run some Oracle SQL code on it. The database documentation is in romanian and it is also available here.
